# System_Monitoring_Alerts

This is a tool developed to monitor the main resources of a server
- Disk
- CPU
- RAM
- Network

It consists of a script that must be attached to a crontab, where you can choose how often you want it to run.
This tool analyzes the resource values and depending on what it gets, it will send a message to the Telegram chat of your choice.
To get your Telegram chat id you can use this bot @userinfobot.

Inside the script you can find the information you have to take into account before running the script.

I hope you like it.
